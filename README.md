Imagine that building teams get getter with every team you build.

Building a team takes effort and time, also big organizations. Unfortunately, this effort is not used to its full extent and the information acquired while building the team is not easily available to the entire organization.

After building a team to complete a project, said team builds, polishes and acquires skills. These skills must be documented and shared so that the next team building search can be better than the previous one.
